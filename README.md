# Server Sided Portals datapack example

## Aim

This simple example datapack provides the basic structure to use [Server Sided Portals](https://github.com/Crystal-Nest/server-sided-portals).  
It adds two dimensions, a copy of the overworld and a complete void one, and defines for each the block tag for the portal frame.  
For the overworld-copy dimension, an item tag is added to change the requirement to light up the portal: a breeze rod (blaze rod in older versions) is required.

## Usage

This datapack can be easily downloaded either as a ready to use archive file (`.zip`) or as source code to be freely customized.
